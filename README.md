# Neural Network
This is a project that I'm putting all my code that I'm making to get to a neural network


## Linear Algebra
This is the first step so I can do the math for the weights for the neurons to make it easier
and so I can understand what is going on in the final code

## Neural Network
This will be a library that makes a 2 step neural network that has an input layer, hidden layer, output layer
with any number of nodes in each layer.
I then want to make it so I can have many hidden layers in the network to make it more useful
